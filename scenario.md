# Mermaid System Scenario
  You are designing a system that needs to:
* A User created a new Thingamajig: I need to mint an ID with an External System
* A User updates the Thingamajig: Update the External System if the change is something they are interested
* A Curator needs to approve the Thingamajig for it to show up publicly in the system


## Questions:
  * What types of user do we have in the system?
  * What are the states an object can go through?
  * What systems do we need to interact with?

## What type of diagrams help us to answer the above questions?
  * flow diagram
  * State diagram
  * Interaction diagram
